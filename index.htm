							<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
							<p>We wanted to experiment with network visualization, particularly in an interactive setting.  We also think topic modeling is fun, and hence decided to take a stab at using topic modeling to construct and visualize two networks.  These networks are driven by reviews of restaurants on Yelp.  We thought it would be interesting to see if something as unstructured as customer opinions would allow us to identify some structure/communities among a network of restaurants and review topics.</p>

							<h2>The Data</h2>
							<p>We used a <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">dataset of reviews released by Yelp</a>, filtered it down to restaurants in Las Vegas, with a minimum of 100 reviews.  This left us with a dataset of reviews from 237 Las Vegas restaurants.  Each review in the filtered dataset was processed using SpaCy and regex (in Python) to get a final set of word tokens.</p>

							<h2>A Network of Restaurants</h2>
							<p>We trained a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model on the reviews' text and used it to determine the ‘topic vector’ for each restaurant.  Using this information, we calculated the Jensen-Shannon distance between each pair of restaurants, and then applied a similarity threshold/cutoff to form linkages between the restaurant nodes.</p>

							<h2>A Network of Topics Emerging from Reviews</h2>
							<p>Using the trained LDA model mentioned above, we obtained a collection of topic vectors for the entire Las Vegas restaurants review text corpus.  We again calculated pairwise Jensen-Shannon distances between topics and then applied a pre-tuned similarity cutoff to form linkages between nodes.</p>

							<h1 align="center">The Good Stuff</h1>
							<h2> Explore a Network of Topics Emerging from Restaurant Reviews </h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Nodes are sized by token contribution.</li>
								<li>Threshold slider allows watching the network change.</li>
								<li>Understand what the topics represent:
									<ul>
										<li>The second slider displays the top ‘characteristic words’ for each topic at dfferent levels of 'relevance'.</li>
										<li>Move the slider to the left to see characteristic words for a topic that are more closely related to the selected topic, i.e. rare words, almost exlcusively appearing in the selected topic.</li>
										<li>Move the slider to the right to see words related to the selected topic that are also commonly found in other topics.</li>
									</ul>
								    </li>
